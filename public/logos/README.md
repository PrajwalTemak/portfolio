# College Logos

Place your college logo images in this folder:

1. **gpp-logo.png** - Government Polytechnic Pune logo
2. **gcoera-logo.png** - Government College of Engineering & Research Avsari logo

## Supported Formats
- PNG (recommended)
- JPG/JPEG
- SVG

## Image Requirements
- Recommended size: 256x256 pixels or larger
- The component will automatically resize and maintain aspect ratio
- Use transparent backgrounds for best results

## How it works
The Education component will automatically detect and display these logos based on the institution name in your database. If a logo is not found, it will fall back to a graduation cap icon.
